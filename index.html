    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[5] with Adolf Rosenberger[11] and Anton Piëch in 1931.[12] The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German, Doktor-Ingenieur honoris causa (lit. 'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree').[13] The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[14] Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[5] but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[5] This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time. Later, the Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.[5]</p>
